# Python API

To date, `dsub` has been designed as a command-line tool.
We are actively working on a Python API for the `dsub`, `dstat`, and `ddel`
functionality.

While we are working on this, you may observe that there are "public" methods
in `dsub.py`, `dstat.py`, and `ddel.py`. You are discouraged from using them
unless you are willing to endure the expected churn as the API evolves. This
API is expected to be very unstable in the near-term.
