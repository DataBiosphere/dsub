"""Single source of truth for dsub's version.

This must remain small and dependency-free so that any dsub module may
import it without creating circular dependencies. Note that this module
is parsed as a text file by setup.py and changes to the format of this
file could break setup.py.

The version should follow formatting requirements specified in PEP-440.
 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440

A typical release sequence will be versioned as:
  0.1.3.dev0 -> 0.1.3 -> 0.1.4.dev0 -> ...
"""

DSUB_VERSION = '0.4.7'
