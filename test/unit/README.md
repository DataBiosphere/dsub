# Python unit tests

## To run all the unit tests:

Stay in the project's directory (where dsub.py is).

 - run through the `virtualenv` steps listed in
   [the project's README](../../README.md) if you haven't already.
 - Type this command below, exactly, to run all the tests in test/unit:
   `python -m unittest discover -s test/unit/`
